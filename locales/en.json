    "title": "About Peggy Granlund",
    "bio": [
      "Peggy Granlund is a passionate painter based in the charming area of Brevik in Tyresö, Sweden. Her inspiration comes from the many places she has visited, the animals and objects around her, and sometimes from places that exist only in her imagination.",
      "Peggy loves the creative process itself—whether she's spending hours on a highly detailed piece or exploring the freedom of a more spontaneous, expressive style. She appreciates both approaches equally, letting each painting take on the form it naturally calls for.",
      "Every painting Peggy creates carries a story. Don't hesitate to ask her about her work if you meet her—she loves sharing the tales behind each piece just as much as she loves hearing how others experience them. In fact, if her art sparks your own story or memory, she would be delighted if you shared it with her. For Peggy, that connection—between art, artist, and viewer—is one of the most beautiful parts of being a painter."
